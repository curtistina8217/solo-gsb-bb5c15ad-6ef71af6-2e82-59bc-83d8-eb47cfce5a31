"""Core wake-separation domain logic.

The service operates on *time in seconds* so the separation matrix (defined
in seconds) can be applied with plain integer arithmetic, no float rounding.

Wake turbulence categories follow the four-class scheme:

``L``  LIGHT    – light aircraft (e.g. PA28, C152)
``M``  MEDIUM   – medium aircraft (most airliners below 136 t)
``H``  HEAVY    – heavy aircraft (>= 136 t MTOW)
``J``  SUPER    – super aircraft (e.g. A380)

Only *adjacent* pairs on the same runway are considered, matching the
operational practice for departures on a single runway: the leader of a pair
is the flight immediately ahead in the departure order.
